# c0mplex-s-tool-config
I personally made this tool for practice servers in CS2.

This is the official repo btw, so check for updates here, and ONLY HERE.

i also didn't know if i needed to gatekeep this or make it public, but i chose option B, so enjoy the tool!

and ffs **PLEASE DONT STEAL IT.**
# Installing the tool.
1. Download the latest version of the tool from the <a href="https://github.com/VadimCanPlay/c0mplex-s-tool-config/releases">Releases tab.</a>
2. Go into Steam, right click CS2 > Manage > Browse local files.
3. In the game files folder, go into game > csgo > cfg
4. Put the config file there.
5. Launch the game if you haven't.
6. Go into a practice (AND YES A PRACTICE) server. You must launch it because you need the owner perms.
7. Run "exec c0mpl3xs_tool_config" in the console. If it doesnt work, check the file name and type "exec " and then the file name.
8. The menu should show up and load all of the commands!
# Q & A:
## How do i make the command list appear again?
Run the exec command that you ran.
## Is it safe to use?
Yes, since its a .cfg file, you can look into the content of it to make sure its safe.
## How do i enable console?
Go into the settings > Game > Enable Developer Console: Yes. Then press the tilda (~) key thats right under the ESC key to open the console.
## How can i bind the config to a short command?
Go into Steam, right click CS2 > Properties, scroll down and paste this into the textbox:
```
+alias commandnamehere "exec c0mpl3xs_tool_config"
```
"commandnamehere" has to be changed to whatever you would like to enter to start up the config. "c0mpl3xs_tool_config" is the file name so if its any different, change it.
